### Week One - THE BASICS
   - **Day 1 (07/06/21)**: What I hope to learn from this program is a greater understanding and appreciation for Artificial Intelligence, as well as gain confidence in skills needed for AI. With the information that I will end up learning from this class, I am sure that I will be able to come up with deep learning networks to solve real problems, which is exciting.
   - **Day 2 (07/07/21)**: In Dr. David Kong's Leadership Seminar, I found that everyone has their own story. We live our own lives, which, in his words, is like the ocean that we swim in. We completed an activity where we had to share our own stories. In the beginning, I was nervous, since to me my life just feels *regular*, even if it is not that way to other people. Additionally, I saw that stories, when told well, have the power to create change, and improve the lives we live in. It can mean more than just simply talking about a life event. One of my contributions to my local community was before the shutdown when I was still back in New York City. I loved going to the Liberty Science Center as a kid, so last year, I chose to volunteer there. I wanted to be able to help get kids like me excited about science, technology, and other things, just like the science center had done for me. I hope that my 180+ hours volunteering there has been able to do just that.
   - **Day 3 (07/08/21)**: The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning comes from the interaction of the coder with the classifications that the code is intended to make. Basically, with supervised learning, the person writing the program already pre-labeled the different items. These labels allow the program to become more accurate, by comparing its predictions with the correct answers that were already given. On the other hand, unsupervised learning has no pre-set labels; the network must find its own patterns, and group the data into clusters. By finding the divide between the clusters, the code can predict what the item is by checking if it falls in a specific cluster. 
     - The statement "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is false, since Scikit learn works best in conjunction with these libraries, rather than simply instead of them.  
  - **Day 4 (07/09/21)**: I wanted to find a dataset on car accidents across the United States, so that it can be able to predict where and when car accidents are most likely to occur, in order to add extra measures to reduce car accidents in those areas and times. I was able to find such a dataset, found here (https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). I chose this data set, since not only does it contain three million recorded accidents all across the United States, but it also stores latitude, longitude, time, and severity for each car accident. These measures would allow for better predictions to be made as to where most accidents would take place.

### Week Two - CNNS, DATA & MACHINE LEARNING
   - **Day 7 (07/12/21)**: Tensors are matrices, but in three dimensions instead of two. They oftentimes can be represented as a matrix with vectors as its elements. In machine learning, tensors can be used to store data with more than two dimensions. A matrix would only be able to store two dimensions of data, which would not be enough for more complicated machine learning datasets. Something that I noticed with some of the computations done is that pandas has multiple different functions that can easily be used to find different parts of the dataset. The head, tail, sample, and describe functions are example of this: easy access to the data. Additionally, I noticed that actually modeling the neural network took a lot less code than pre-processing the data, which is interesting since most of the internal work is done when modeling/running the neural network.
