   - **Day 1 (07/06/21)**: What I hope to learn from this program is a greater understanding and appreciation for Artificial Intelligence, as well as gain confidence in skills needed for AI. With the information that I will end up learning from this class, I am sure that I will be able to come up with deep learning networks to solve real problems, which is exciting.
   - **Day 2 (07/07/21)**: In Dr. David Kong's Leadership Seminar, I found that everyone has their own story. We live our own lives, which, in his words, is like the ocean that we swim in. We completed an activity where we had to share our own stories. In the beginning, I was nervous, since to me my life just feels *regular*, even if it is not that way to other people. Additionally, I saw that stories, when told well, have the power to create change, and improve the lives we live in. It can mean more than just simply talking about a life event. One of my contributions to my local community was before the shutdown when I was still back in New York City. I loved going to the Liberty Science Center as a kid, so last year, I chose to volunteer there. I wanted to be able to help get kids like me excited about science, technology, and other things, just like the science center had done for me. I hope that my 180+ hours volunteering there has been able to do just that.
